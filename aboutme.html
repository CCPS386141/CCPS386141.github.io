    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>The goals that I work towards are finishing school and getting a successful career. I need to finish school in order to get a successful career, so that is a main goal. The experience growing up of seeing and hearing people be mistreated and mourn for justice makes me lean towards becoming somewhere near a lawyer. I could take any career I find interesting, I just need to do well and study really hard about it. I am working towards my goals by staying in school and trying my best to keep my grades high. I've been practicing and studying for all of my classes and trying to find a career I find interesting. The values I consider necessary for my success are open mindsets, adaptability,  honesty, and integrity. Adaptability and integrity are the most important values to me, you need to know how to slide your work into a regular routine and be reliable. I hope to be able to join dual enrollment, finish school with good grades, and learn how to communicate better. I have already been working towards finishing the school year and improving my GPA, as I am around halfway done, and have thought about my plans for dual enrollment. Communication is something I still need to work on, I hope to be able to become independent and communicate in a comfortable manner. These lead to the character traits and achievements I want to be known for, consciousness, generosity, courage, and fairness. I also want to be known for how I live my life, its short and you can only do so much.</p>
